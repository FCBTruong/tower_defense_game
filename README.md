# 2D Mobile Game Project

## Overview
This is a 2D mobile game developed as part of my university coursework during my second year. The game was created using **LibGDX**, a popular framework for developing cross-platform games, and the **Java** programming language. It runs on multiple platforms, including **iOS**, **Android**, and desktop.
